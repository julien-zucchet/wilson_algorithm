# Wilson's algorithm

Here is an implementation of Wilson's algorithm on Python, with a possible application which generates mazes. The animation in Python is pretty slow due to my lack of proficiency for this aspect of Python. The mazes created can also be solved thanks to a depth search.

The "draw_maze.py" file is for drawing a maze.
The "wilsons_algorithm_erased_online.py" file displays the evolution of the algorithm live.
